# SPEC-001: Modular Property Management Application

## Background

The need for this system arises from the inefficiencies in manually managing property-related tasks, such as rent tracking, tenant communication, receipt generation, and financial reporting. The current workflow relies on a combination of spreadsheets and manual effort, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating these tasks and centralizing property management into a modular, extensible web application would streamline operations and allow scalability for future enhancements.

The system is envisioned as a SaaS web application tailored for individual landlords and property managers. Initially, it will focus on core features such as rent tracking, receipt generation, and tenant communication. Future iterations will add features like financial reporting, maintenance scheduling, property value tracking, and enhancements to improve tenant satisfaction.

## Requirements

The application must address the following needs, prioritized using the MoSCoW method:

### Must Have:
- Automated receipt generation for rent payments (customizable templates, auto-date, and receipt number).
- Rent tracking for multiple properties with payment status and history.
- Basic tenant management (contact info, lease agreements, communication history).
- Email functionality to send receipts and other tenant communications.
- Dashboard for tracking rent collection and viewing upcoming payments.
- Secure user authentication and authorization for property managers.

### Should Have:
- Maintenance scheduling and tracking, including tenant requests.
- Property financial tracking, including integration with CRA rental property tax criteria for Canadian users.
- Automated emails for tenant birthdays or lease anniversaries.

### Could Have:
- Tools for tracking property value and potential upgrades with estimated value increase.
- Support for integrating e-transfer payment tracking via financial APIs.
- Multi-language support for international landlords.

### Wonâ€™t Have (for now):
- Direct payment processing (e.g., credit card payments via the application).
- Advanced CRM-like functionality for managing large portfolios.
