    # Project Overview
    This project, MyPropMate, is a modular property management application designed to simplify tasks like rent tracking, tenant communication, and financial reporting. The primary goal is to automate these workflows and replace manual processes with efficient and scalable solutions. 

    Currently, the project focuses on:
    1. Automated receipt generation for tenants using an Excel template as the base.
    2. Rent tracking for properties.
    3. Tenant management features for basic contact and lease details.

    The long-term vision includes expanding into a SaaS platform for landlords and property managers.

    # Architecture and Design Choices
    - **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for a modern, type-safe, and scalable UI.
    - **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript and Express.js for a RESTful API.
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data like users, properties, tenants, and receipts.
    - **Receipt Template**: Excel is used as the base for receipts, dynamically populated with tenant and payment details using Python and the `openpyxl` library.
    - **Email Service**: Planned integration with SendGrid for automated email receipts.
    - **Hosting**: Cloud hosting (e.g., Vercel for frontend, AWS/Heroku for backend).

    # Current Implementation
    ### Folder Structure
    ```
    /backend
    /src
        /routes
        receiptRoutes.ts  # Routes for receipt-related operations
        server.ts           # Main Express app
    tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration for backend
    package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
    /frontend
    src/
        App.tsx             # Main React app entry point
        components/         # Reusable components
    package.json          # Dependencies and scripts
    /docs
    requirements.md       # Project requirements and milestones
    architecture.md       # Architecture and design details
    ```

    ### Progress
    - Backend has been initialized with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.
    - Routes for handling receipt generation logic are planned.
    - Excel template modification has been prototyped using Python's `openpyxl`.

    # Immediate Next Steps
    1. **Backend**:
    - Finalize the `/api/receipts` endpoint in `receiptRoutes.ts` to accept receipt details (tenant name, amount, etc.) and save them to the database.
    - Integrate a Python script for modifying the Excel template dynamically.
    - Add a feature to return the updated receipt as a downloadable PDF.

    2. **Frontend**:
    - Build a form component for submitting tenant and receipt data (React + TypeScript).
    - Implement an API call to the backend `/api/receipts` endpoint upon form submission.
    - Display a success message and a link to download the generated receipt.

    3. **Testing**:
    - Test the backend API using Postman with sample receipt data.
    - Test the Python script locally with real Excel templates.

    # Copilot's Role
    - Assist with writing backend APIs in TypeScript (e.g., `/api/receipts`).
    - Suggest Python code for automating Excel modification and saving as PDF.
    - Generate TypeScript interfaces for tenant and receipt data structures.
    - Help with React components for the frontend form and API integration.

    ---

    # Code to Focus On
    1. Define a TypeScript interface for receipt details:
    ```typescript
    interface Receipt {
    invoiceNumber: number;
    tenantName: string;
    amount: number;
    date: string;
    }
    ```

    2. Create an Express POST route for `/api/receipts`:
    ```typescript
    router.post("/generate", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    const { tenantName, amount, date } = req.body;
    // Call Python script here or save data to database
    res.json({ message: "Receipt generated", receiptPath: "path/to/receipt.pdf" });
    });
    ```

    3. Add a Python script call in the backend using Node's `child_process`:
    ```typescript
    import { exec } from "child_process";

    exec("python3 generate_receipt.py", (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error(`Error: ${stderr}`);
        return;
    }
    console.log(`Success: ${stdout}`);
    });
    ```

    4. React form component to collect receipt data:
    ```tsx
    const ReceiptForm: React.FC = () => {
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ tenantName: "", amount: 0, date: "" });

    const handleSubmit = async () => {
        const response = await fetch("/api/receipts/generate", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
        });
        const result = await response.json();
        console.log(result);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        {/* Add input fields here */}
        </form>
    );
    };
    ```

    Use this as a guide to ensure that all components and logic are implemented cohesively. Let me know if you need further assistance with specific features!

    ### Usage:
    - Paste this prompt into a comment or text file in VS Code for reference.
    - When using GitHub Copilot, contextually add pieces of the prompt in relevant files (e.g., add code-related sections in `server.ts` or `receiptRoutes.ts`).

    This will give Copilot clarity about your project's scope and help it generate precise suggestions.
